# Benchmarking-Deep-Learning-Frameworks
## The frameworks that are included in this benchmark are:
  1-Keras
  2-Chainer
  3-Tensorflow
  4-Pytorch 
  5-Theano
  6-Mxnet 

## The Experiments comparing those frameworks over 4 datsets:
  1- MNIST
  2- CIFAR10
  3- CIFAR100
  4- SVHN

There are two experiments one of them uses CPU and the other uses GPU.

## This repository is divided into 3 folders:
  1- CPU Experiment 
    It contain the CPU experiment 
  2- GPU Experiment 
    It contain the GPU experiment 
  3- Installation Guide
    It contains the required packages to be included for each environment.

  
 ## Experiment Logging:
  there exist 3 files for logging the resources during the experiment: CPU log, GPU Log, memory Log.
  
## How to run?
  There is a method in the main function that is called runModel, this methods holds the name of the dataset and the number of       epochs needed for this run.
